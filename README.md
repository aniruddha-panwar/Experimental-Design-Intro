# Experimental-Design-Intro

Concepts with applications in R

## INTRO
The repository holds my work in taking a self taught approach towards experimental design. From my interview experience, the push towards experimental design is strong in the data roles at the silicon valley.

The main source material on this learning Journey comes from [Experimental Design in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/experimental-design-in-r) course on datacamp taught by Kaelen Medeiros; a datascientist at HealthLabs.

The contents of this project include -

* Introduction to Experimental Design
* Basic Experiments
* Randomized Complete (& Balanced Incomplete) Block Designs
* Latin Squares, Graeco-Latin Squares, & Factorial experiments
